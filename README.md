# Ninny Code!

Nintendo Switch owners know that adding friends isn't as easy as it could be. Remembering a randomly generated 12-digit friend code is cumbersome. With no way to add friends within the Switch or a way to change your friend code, Nintendo leaves a lot to be desired. With Ninny Code! you can create a username and add your friend code. Now, all have to send to your friends is a short url!
